# Kujo68K

Cycle-accurate M68000 emulation library, kinda

A (WIP) cycle-accurate emulation library for the M68000 processor, writen in C++17.

## Features

Platform-independent and architecture-independent code

Derived from the original M68000 microcode

Clock-cycle ticked emulation (inspired by the [chips emulation project](https://github.com/floooh/chips/tree/master))

And more to come!


# Plans

## Near-term

Finish up current implementation (interrupt-related functionality and a bunch of ALU-related functions still missing)

## Medium-term

Implement bus arbitration and bus error logic

## Long-term

M68008 support
